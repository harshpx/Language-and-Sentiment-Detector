## Overview
A Flask based web app that contains multiple Machine Learning models using NLP.
(UI is designed using Basic HTML and CSS)

**Currently this app contains:**
* Emotion DetectorüòäüòÆüò±ü•∞üò†
* Sentiment Detectorüëçüèªüëéüèª
* Language Detector(ÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿä, ‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä, Engilsh, ‡πÅ‡∏ö‡∏ö‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢ etc.)

It uses various trained Machine Learning and Deep Learning models at the backend, and API is created using Flask.

## Brief Project Description
This Project currently uses 3 trained Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models.

1. **Emotion Detection**
* It is a Multiclass classification Model that uses various small datasets of texts and labelled emotion from Kaggle. 
* Data from various Sources are then combined to compile a big dataset (Data Augmentation).
* The overall combined dataset consists of approx 30,000 labelled texts, that spans accross 9 emotions. Namely: `anger`, `disgust`, `fear`, `guilt`, `joy`, `love`, `sadness`, `shame` and `surprise`. (A 9 class classification problem)
* Various Machine Learning classification Models are applied on the processed data.
* The best performing models were: `Linear SVM` and `Logistic Regression`, both achieved an accuray of ~*80%*.
* Hence a `Stacking Ensemble Classifier` is used to combine the above two models and it performed slightly better than both of them (as expected).
* Final accuracy achieved: **81%**. (Decent for a 9-class classification).

2. **Sentiment Detection**
* It is also a Multiclass classification Model that uses a modified dataset derived from `Sentiment 140`, that has 50k tweets spanning accross 3 sentiments. Namely: `Positive`, `Neutral` and `Negative`. (A 3 class classification problem)
* Various Machine Learning Classifiers like: `Logistic Regression`, `SVM`, `Decision Trees`, `Naive Bayes`, `KNN` etc. are tested during Hyperparameter Tuning (using `GridSearchCV()`)
`Logistic Regression` performed best among them and achieved an accuray of **82%**.

* Deep Learning Models are also applied on this dataset. A `Bi-Directional LSTM` based Neural Network is trained upon this dataset, which further enhanced the accuracy to **83%** (slight, but still relevant)

3. **Language Detection**
* It is a Multiclass classification Model, uses a Dataset of 22000 text samples of 22 different languages. (1000 data instances of each language)
* Model is trained using `Naive Bayes` algorithm. ```Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes that the features in the input data are independent of each other given the class label.```
